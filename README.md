# snakecpp
This is the Snake Game made using c++

It includes two classes Screen and Snakepart 

Controls are - A,S,W,D

The only two things missing are - 

1. Snake not moving forward after some time

2. No dynamic allocations in the snakepart which represents the location of each snakepart in screen
